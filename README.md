This project started as a part of my quest to get get a free, open source youtube playlist video downloader, but I guess as much as I kept working on it, I wanted it to be more, a general download manager.

To use it:
Download the project and run it on visual studio, preferable version 2015 and above.
Paste the youtube link you want to download the video from
click on download.

To contribute to the project: 
You can clone it and improve it
You can create a new branch and also work on it
Or any other way that contributes to it 

This is just a version 1.0.0 which will download only one video at a time. I intend to publish version 2.0.0 which will be able to download the whole youtube playlist of videos and a version 3.0.0 which will be a general download manager for all your downloads. A completely free, open source download manager that you can use for all your downloads. 

Please comment and contribute to the project, I don't know if i can qualify to call myself a beginner or an intermediate programmer because I am definetly not a pro lol..
